Hi there

# Notes
This uses Lombok, which is a boilerplate helper.
If you open this project in an IDE without Lombok support, you may see a lot of red. Even so, the project will still compile.
If you would like to eliminate the red, Eclipse and IntelliJ both have Lombok pluigns, but this is not required.
